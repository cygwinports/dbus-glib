ldesc: "D-BUS is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk
to one another.

D-BUS supplies both a system daemon (for events such as 'new hardware
device added' or 'printer queue changed') and a per-user-login-session
daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the
message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing
framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly
(without going through the message bus daemon)."
